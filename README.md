## Overview
- This project is for finding permission of all user

- Question 3:
+  I use design pattern composite to design this project
+  We have N user + CEO => Space complexity is O(n)
+ Time complexity to calculate permission for one leaf node is O(1) 
+ Time complexity to calculate permission for 1 parent is O(N) , N is number of child of parent
+ Time complexity to calculate permission for 1 CEO and N leaf node is O(H*N) , H is height of tree and N is number of leaf node
